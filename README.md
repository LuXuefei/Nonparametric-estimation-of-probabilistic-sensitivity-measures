* The 21-input Additive Gassian simulator
 Y=\sum_{i=1}^{21}a_i X_i
where X_i ~ Normal(1,1), with a_1 = ... = a_7 = -4, a_8 =... = a_{14} = 2, and a_{15} = ... = a_{21} = 1. The 21 inputs are correlated with \rho(i,j) = 0.5 .

* The Bayesian nonparametric conditional estimator requires codes of the work
